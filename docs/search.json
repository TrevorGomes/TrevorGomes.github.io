I then group the data by team so that my subsequent mutation, adding the average number of offensive plays the team ran per game, applies to each team individually and not the entire dataset.\nI then selected AveragePlays, TotalPlays, and Team to simplify my dataset and make it only include those three columns.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(\n    data = bigtenplays_24,\n    aes(\n      x = reorder(Team, AveragePlays),\n      weight = AveragePlays\n          )) +\n      labs(\n        title = \"2024-25 Big Ten Teams By Number of Offensive Plays\",\n        x = \"School\",\n        y = \"Average Offensive Plays per Game\"\n      ) +\n  theme_light() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis data reflects time of possession, yards per play (somewhat), and other factors, but it more so displays the tempo each team’s offense plays with. The numbers certainly don’t reflect the quality of a team because Maryland, Rutgers, and USC - the top three teams in average offensive plays per game - played to an 18-20 record in the 2024-25 season.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(\n    data = bigtenplays_25,\n    aes(\n      x = reorder(Team, AveragePlays),\n      weight = AveragePlays\n          )) +\n      labs(\n        title = \"2025-26 Big Ten Teams By Number of Offensive Plays\",\n        x = \"School\",\n        y = \"Average Offensive Plays per Game\"\n      ) +\n  theme_light() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following season, Rutgers, Maryland, and Nebraska remained in the top five by average offensive plays per game, though there were some significant changes at the bottom and middle of the dataset. Purdue went from last in 2024-25 to third in 2025-26 so far. Indiana went from middle of the pack last season to second so far this season.\nOhio State, interestingly, has remained near the bottom of the conference, despite being the Big Ten’s premier team in both seasons. Illinois and UCLA have also stayed near the bottom in offensive plays per game."

This data in itself isn’t too useful without context, though. To better gauge how the Terps’ scoring stacks up to other teams, we need to analyze another team.\nI’ll choose Nebraska to take a look at the scoring breakdown for one of the nation’s premier programs.\n\n\nCode\nneb_matches_2025 &lt;- matches_2025 |&gt; filter(team == \"Nebraska\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nneb_matches_2025 |&gt; group_by(team) |&gt; summarise(\n  total_kills = sum(kills),\n  total_blocks = sum(block_solos + block_assists),\n  total_aces = sum(aces),\n  total_opp_errors = sum(defensive_errors)\n)\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 5\n  team     total_kills total_blocks total_aces total_opp_errors\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Nebraska         777          258         60              325\n\n\n\n\nCode\nneb &lt;- c(\"Kills\"=777, \"Blocks\"=258, \"Aces\"=60, \"Opponent Errors\"=325)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nwaffle(\n neb/3,\n rows = 10,\n title = \"Nebraska Volleyball's Points\",\n xlab = \"1 square = 1 point\",\ncolors = c(\"red\", \"black\",\"grey\",\"tan\") \n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince Nebraska has considerably more points than Maryland, I’ll need to add “padding” to Maryland’s points total to ensure that each waffle chart is displaying data on the same scale. Otherwise, each waffle chart would display different-sized squares.\nSince Nebraska’s points total is 1,420 and Maryland’s is 1,070, I’ll add 350 squares of padding. To do this, I’ll add a set of 350 unnamed squares to the waffle chart.\n\n\nCode\nmd &lt;- c(\"Kills\"=525, \"Blocks\"=216, \"Aces\"=72, \"Opponent Errors\"=257, 350)\n\n\n\n\nCode\niron(\nwaffle(\n md/3,\n rows = 10,\n title = \"Maryland Volleyball's Points\",\n xlab = \"1 square = 1 point\",\ncolors = c(\"red\", \"black\",\"gold\",\"grey\", \"white\") \n),\nwaffle(\n neb/3,\n rows = 10,\n title = \"Nebraska Volleyball's Points\",\n xlab = \"1 square = 1 point\",\ncolors = c(\"red\", \"black\",\"grey\",\"tan\") \n))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKills, blocks, aces, and opponent errors account for roughly the same share of both teams’ total points. Nebraska seems to accumulate slightly more of its points from kills, and maybe a bit more from opponent errors, compared to Maryland, but aside from that, the proportionality of all four stats is largely the same.\nThe share of these stats may not be the most indicative of how good a team is overall, but rather how proficient the team is in a specific area. If a team had a considerable share of its points from blocks, for example, that would show that they likely have a sturdy defense.\nI would have to create and analyze waffle charts for other teams to determine how Maryland and Nebraska’s share of statistics are typical, or if they both differ from the average. I’d imagine that the most significant variation comes from the number of blocks and aces a team has tallied, because most of a team’s points will naturally come from kills and opponent errors."

The Big Ten had a bit more variance during that stretch.\nIn 2021, 10.5% of games saw the winning team fall short of the 100-rushing-yards mark. The percentage for all 1,659 games across every conference that year was 6.3%.\nFive years earlier, however, only four of the 180 Big Ten games (2.2%) featured the victorious team amassing fewer than 100 rushing yards, which was lower than the national mark of 3.1%.\nThis sparks a question about how the passing game of Big Ten teams have changed during this span. In years where the percentage of teams that won with low rushing yards totals is lower, is the average passing yards also lower (meaning the passing game couldn’t compensate for the running game’s deficiencies)?"

The top four teams in the nation by RPI – Maryland, Vermont, Princeton, and Virginia – especially feature seniors in their offenses. This may be a coaching decision, a product of how many seniors these teams have, or simply because these seniors are getting the most touches.\nAn interesting detail in this plot is the noticable increase from juniors to seniors. There are markedly more seniors that have recorded over 15 shots on goal this season than juniors. A year of collegiate experience can certainly make a profound difference, but it’s a bit surprising that the jump from junior to senior is that pronounced. The increase from freshmen to sophomores is also noteworthy because it illustrates how formative a player’s first collegiate season is. Few freshmen are trusted enough to attempt a high number of shots on goal, but after they notch a year’s worth of collegiate experience, they’re incorporated into the offense more."

The lone outlier is its most recent game against Rutgers, where the Terps rushed for over 10 yards per attempt. Aside from that game, though, Maryland’s yards per carry has loomed around four or below.\nThe metric is fairly indicative of team success across the Big Ten. Indiana, Michigan, Oregon and USC - some of the conference’s best teams – have consistently rushed for more than the Big Ten average. Ohio State is somewhat of an anomaly because, despite being the No. 1 team in the nation, its run game has been about average relative to the rest of the conference. Illinois and Washington are interesting cases because they have some of the conference’s least efficient rushing performances by yards per carry, but are still solid teams. Analyzing those performances would be an intriguing next step to take with this story."

I chose to define “early-season” as the first eight games of a season because that usually encompasses most or all of non-conference play. The metrics I chose to analyze are point differential (a solid indicator of general team success, on both sides of the floor), rebound differential, and free throw differential (two of Buzz’s points of emphasis for the team this season).\nMaryland’s point differential is mediocre compared to its results since 2016. This could be attributed to the limited sample size, however, and the fact that Maryland has played Big East opponents in two of its first four games. Other years’ point differentials may also be skewed by extreme blowouts, such as the 2024-25 squad’s 71-point win over Canisius.\nIn my opinion, the worthwhile story comes from the rebound differential and free throw differential. Buzz has derided the team’s rebounding this year, and the numbers support that. Maryland has a slim average rebounding advantage of 2.75 this season, its second-lowest in the last 10 seasons. This is especially surprising considering that Buzz Williams-coached teams in the past have excelled in rebounding. Last year’s Texas A&M team was one of the nation’s best rebounding teams.\nBuzz has also spoken about how Maryland has had to shoot free throws this year to sustain its offense, which the statistics also show. On average, the Terps have shot nine more free throws than their opponents this season – their second-highest mark in the past decade."

During his time at Virginia Tech, his teams were surprisingly far below the national average in rebounds and offensive rebounds per game, though that trend changed drastically when he took over Texas A&M in 2019. Williams’ teams in College Station were among the best offensive rebounding units in the country, and were mostly above average in rebounding during his tenure.\nIn the two years prior to Williams’ arrival, Maryland was a roughly average rebounding team. Though it’s early in the season, they’ve been worse this year than in those two years. The Terps’ rebounding and offensive rebounding have been weaknesses so far this year (much to Buzz’s dismay).\nWilliams’ teams have been consistently great at drawing contact, however. Save for his final year with Virginia Tech, the Hokies under Buzz Williams took considerably more free throws than average. Williams’ teams in his final three years with Texas A&M were especially prolific from the free-throw line. Maryland was also above average in free throws per game in the two years before Buzz’s arrival, but this year, they’ve shot about 10 more free throws than the national average.\nWilliams’ teams have been slightly above average from a scoring standpoints. During his days at Virginia Tech, the team was above average in points per game from 2015-16 to 2018-19, and in Texas A&M, they were even closer to the national average. Maryland is averaging its highest points per game in the past decade so far this season, though the limited sample size is skewing that number. The team’s offense will be truly evaluated when they enter conference play,"

Despite the wretchedly poor plus/minus, Brian Keefe and company have played those lineups more than the top three positive lineups. Khris Middleton and CJ McCollum, the team’s two most accomplished veterans, are featured in all three of the Wizards’ most positive lineups."
